Getting started
===============

Clone this repo, and then `cd d3-hacking` and run `npm install` to get all the dependencies installed.

If you don't have grunt installed globally, you'll need to run `npm install -g grunt` as well.

After that, just run `grunt` from the repo directory to startup the watcher, which includes live reload.
